                  <p> My name is Scott Wells I grew up in Bowling Green, Kentucky. After highschool I joined the United States Army and I served as a enlisted cannoneer at Fort Hood, Texas.
                     Upon completion of my service I was honorably discharged from the Military and I went back home to Bowling Green, Kentucky to attend Western Kentucky University.
                     Where I Majored in Marketing and I graduated with a bachelors of science in marketing. Before graduating I accepted an entry level sales position with what was at the time Dell, Inc.
                     (Dell Technologies). So I moved to Nashville and I began my career in technology sales at Dell. Over the last 15 years I have held various sales and technical presales postions 
                     that are highlighted on
                     my linkedin page(link included). Recently due to many economic factors my position was eliminated, but with one door closing. Another door opens and now I have the opportunity 
                     to learn how to code and that is why I am attending a codeing bootcamp to build a solid foundation in coding by diving into the deep end of coding and learning by coding.
                     <p>
                     I have significant cloud and infrastructure knowledge by understanding software code and development. It better completes my knowledge level.
                     So that I can be a better solutions architect and aspiring full time developer and E commerce entrepreneur. Please contact me to discuss postions
